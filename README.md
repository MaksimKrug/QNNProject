# QNNProject

# Description
The main goal of this project is trying to reproduce a concept of paper [Quanvolutional Neural Networks: Powering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04767). As a framework I used [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/) and for backend - [AWS Bracket](https://aws.amazon.com/ru/braket/)
